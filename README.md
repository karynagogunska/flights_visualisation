# flights_visualisation

This code creates an animation of all flights I had in my life. Visualization is overlayed an incomlete Eurasia map. 

I collected my personal flights destinations and dates from my emails, flying apps and photos and arranged them in .csv file. 




This code is heavily inspired by similar project https://github.com/ksenianiglas/mapping_flight_paths
Thank you @ksenianiglas
